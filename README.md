# ZMK-Config

Best way to view the keymap is via [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/)
and paste the contents of [config/glove80.keymap](https://github.com/nocksock/zmk-config/blob/main/config/glove80.keymap).

## Build

Requires [Toolchain Setup](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/setup).

There's a dirty bash script to build keymaps from within here:

```bash
./build.sh build
```

or to watch for changes and build automatically:

```bash
./build.sh watch
```
